## Hospital Quality Analysis

The programs in this repository have been created as part of an assignment of Coursera's Data Science Specialization Course.

The data for this assignment come from the Hospital Compare web site (http://hospitalcompare.hhs.gov) run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The purpose of the web site is to provide data and information about the quality of care at over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals in the U.S. This dataset essentially covers all major U.S. hospitals. This dataset is used for a variety of purposes, including determining whether hospitals should be fined for not providing high quality care to patients.

The data is available at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog%2Fdata%2FProgAssignment3-data.zip

The zip file for this assignment contains three files
* outcome-of-care-measures.csv: Contains information about 30-day mortality and readmission rates
for heart attacks, heart failure, and pneumonia for over 4,000 hospitals.
* hospital-data.csv: Contains information about each hospital.
* Hospital_Revised_Flatfiles.pdf: Descriptions of the variables in each file (i.e the code book).
